## Experience

### Rebhu Computing Private Limited  
**Control Systems Team Lead (Full-time)**  
**May 2023 - Present**  

- **Sensor Calibration Suite**: Developed an auto-calibration pipeline for automotive-grade IMU sensors, reducing startup time by 20%.
- **Autonomous Path Tracking**: Designed a control system using PID and Stanley controllers for autonomous tractors, achieving RTK GPS accuracy (~10-25 cm) and <2s settling time at 30 km/h in off-road conditions.
- **Autonomous State Estimation and Localization**:
  - Developed an error-state Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF) for fusing GPS, IMU, and camera data.
  - Achieved robust state estimation in GPS-denied environments, enabling deployment on drones and UGVs.
- **End-to-End Vehicle Control**:
  - Developed a PyTorch-based **Liquid Neural Network** (NCP framework) for real-time vehicle control.
  - Achieved 1000x fewer parameters than traditional models, ensuring faster inference and robust adaptability.
- **Simulation Development**:
  - Built an **Isaac Sim-based** environment for testing autonomous vehicle algorithms, reducing deployment costs and halving development time.
  - Integrated **PX4, ArduPilot, and ROS2** for multi-vehicle testing with high-fidelity sensor models.
- **Photogrammetry**:
  - Developed a **monoplotting algorithm** for GPS-based object tracking and dynamic target engagement with drones.
